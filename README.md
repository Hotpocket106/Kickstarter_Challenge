Purpose

We are dividing mass datasets into readable and visuallized data for us to better understanding and analylize the data.
Creating the pivot table and charts allows us to filter variables to easliy find the values that we need.


- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the "Outcomes Besed On Launch Date" We can see a dramatic successful kickstarter goal inseasing in the month of April and May and dives down slowly through out the year.
In the month of October there are no cancellations for the show

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the "Outcomes based on Goals" Chart
We see a lower successful rate drop as the Goal amount reaching higher
Cancellation and fail rate inscrese as the goal amount increases 
More goals are reached for kickstarter goal under $1000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
For the Kickstater sheet we cannot know the reason of cancellation so we cannot sort the reason why there kickstarters are being canceled.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can also create a boxplot chart to see a mean of average goal and pleaged amount.
Pie chart is also useful for us to visually see the percentage of success, fail and canceled rate to have better understanding of the goal reaches.
